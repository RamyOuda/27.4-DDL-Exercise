-- Schema should keep track of the standings/rankings of each team in the league
-- (This doesnâ€™t have to be its own table if the data can be captured somehow)

-- This can be done by counting the number of times a team's id appears inside of the 'goals' table, then ordering it by DESC

-- SELECT team_id, COUNT(team_id) AS total_goals
-- FROM goals
-- GROUP BY team_id
-- ORDER BY total_goals DESC;
